SQL_TEST_CSVexport builds off of full parse. takes patent data and puts it into a SQL queryable table. can export the table to CSV, JSON file formats. all that's left for data work is to download all of the .xml files, put them into the folder and run through all of them to create a final CSV file/SQL database.
