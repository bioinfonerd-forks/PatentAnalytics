  "title": "METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR MITIGATING ARC FLASH INCIDENT ENERGY IN MOTOR CONTROL DEVICES",
  "abstract": "Industrial motor control apparatus and techniques are presented for mitigating incident energy associated with an internal arcing. Interior enclosure surfaces and/or surfaces of electrical components are provided with textures and/or coatings which may be non-reflective with respect to visible and/or infrared light in order to redirect or absorb incident energy associated with internal arcing conditions. The electrical components are also arranged so as to substantially minimize the percentage of back wall exposure, and filler material and/or tile structures may be mounted within the enclosure, which may be non-reflective and/or have textured surfaces or coating layers to mitigate incident arcing energy. In addition, baffles or barriers may be provided within the enclosure to redirect or absorb incident energy from internal arcing."
  "claims": "1. A method for mitigating incident energy associated with an internal arcing condition within an industrial control or motor control apparatus, the method comprising: mounting at least one electrical component within an interior of an enclosure comprising an upper wall, a lower wall, at least one sidewall, and a back wall; providing at least one of a textured surface and a coating layer on at least a portion of an interior surface of at least one of the walls of the enclosure to redirect or absorb incident energy associated with an internal arcing condition within the enclosure.2. The method of claim 1, wherein the textured surface or the coating layer is non-reflective with respect to visible and infrared light.3. The method of claim 1, comprising providing at least one of a textured surface and a coating layer on the at least one electrical component to redirect or absorb incident energy associated with an internal arcing condition within the enclosure.4. The method of claim 1, comprising mounting at least one tile structure directly or indirectly to the interior surface of at least one of the walls or to the at least one electrical component, the at least one tile structure comprising at least one of a textured surface and a coating layer to redirect or absorb incident energy associated with an internal arcing condition within the enclosure.5. The method of claim 4, wherein the at least one tile structure is non-reflective with respect to visible and infrared light.6. The method of claim 1, comprising mounting a filler material within the enclosure interior, the filler material operative to redirect or absorb incident energy associated with an internal arcing condition within the enclosure.7. The method of claim 6, wherein the filler material is non-reflective with respect to visible and infrared light.8. The method of claim 1, comprising mounting at least one baffle or barrier within the enclosure interior, the at least one baffle or barrier operative to redirect or absorb incident energy associated with an internal arcing condition within the enclosure.9. The method of claim 8, wherein the at least one baffle or barrier is non-reflective with respect to visible and infrared light.10. The method of claim 8, wherein the at least one baffle or barrier comprises at least one of a textured surface and a coating layer to redirect or absorb incident energy associated with an internal arcing condition within the enclosure.11. A method for mitigating incident energy associated with an internal arcing condition within an industrial control or motor control apparatus, the method comprising: arranging a plurality of electrical components within an interior of an enclosure comprising an upper wall, a lower wall, at least one sidewall, and a back wall to substantially minimize a percentage of exposure of highly reflective or smooth interior surfaces in the interior of the enclosure in order to facilitate redirection or absorption of incident energy associated with an internal arcing condition within the enclosure."
