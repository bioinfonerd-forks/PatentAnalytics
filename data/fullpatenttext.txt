<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 2011-0030305, filed on Apr. 1, 2011 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments relate to a closed type display apparatus installed at an outdoor area.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In general, a display apparatus is an apparatus configured to form an image: for example, a television, a monitor for a computer, or a digital information display.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, a Digital Information Display (DID), which is used to provide advertisements and information, accommodates a computer system, including a high performance central processing unit (CPU), and uses a high brightness-liquid crystal module which generates a great amount of heat. In this regard, heat dissipation of the DID is required to ensure the reliability of the DID.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, when the DID is disposed for use in an outdoor area, the DID is sealed to a high degree to prevent alien substances such as moisture and dust from intruding to the inside of a main body of the DID.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, such a high degree of sealing of the case inhibits air from circulating between the inside and the outside of the case, causing a difficulty in dissipating heat dissipation through air circulation between inside and outside a case.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One or more exemplary embodiments provide a display apparatus capable of providing a superior cooling performance while satisfying a high degree of sealing requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additional aspects of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an aspect of an exemplary embodiment, a display apparatus includes a liquid crystal module, at least one circuit board, a case, a frame and a blower fan. The liquid crystal module includes a liquid crystal panel which displays an image. The at least one circuit board is disposed at a rear side of the liquid crystal module and controls an operation of the liquid crystal panel. The case accommodates the liquid crystal mode and the at least one circuit board therewithin, such that the liquid crystal module and the at least one circuit board are sealed within a main chamber formed by the case. The frame is provided in the chamber to divide the chamber into a first chamber and a second chamber. The blower fan is provided on the frame and allows the flow of gas between the first chamber and the second chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The case includes a front case and a back case. The front case has a front surface and a rear surface that are open. The back case is coupled to the open rear surface of the front case.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The front case includes a first coupling part that is formed along a circumference of the open rear surface such that the back case is coupled to the second front case by means of the first coupling part. The first coupling part and the back case are sealed to each other by means of a first sealing member.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The display apparatus further includes a protection glass disposed at a front side of the liquid crystal module to protect the liquid crystal module.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The front case includes a first front case coupled to a front circumferential side of the protection glass, and a second front case forming a lateral side part of the front case and coupled to the first front case.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The protection glass and the first front case are sealed to each other by means of a second sealing member.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The frame a mold frame having an empty inside.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The frame includes at least two transverse frame parts and at least two longitudinal frame parts each having a length longer than a length of each of the transverse frame parts.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The frame divides the chamber into the first chamber disposed within the frame and the second chamber disposed outside the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The element or elements within the first chamber generate a greater amount of heat than the element or elements within the second chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The frame includes a substrate mounting part which contacts a rear surface of the liquid crystal module, wherein the substrate mounting part comprises at least one opening that exposes the rear surface of the liquid crystal module to the first chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The blower fan includes a first blower fan and a second blower fan. The first blower fan is disposed on a first transverse frame part and directs gas from the first chamber to the second chamber. The second blower fan is disposed on a second transverse frame part and directs gas from the second chamber to the first chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each of the first blower fan and the second blower fan includes at least one axial fan.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The movement of fluid forms a plurality of loops.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the second front case <b>22</b> is provided with a first coupling part <b>23</b> formed along a circumference of the open rear surface of the front case <b>20</b> such that the second front case <b>22</b> is coupled to the back case <b>30</b> via the first coupling part. The first coupling part <b>23</b> and the back case <b>30</b> are securely coupled to each other through a fastening member (S). A first sealing member <b>12</b> formed using rubber, or another suitable material, is interposed between the first coupled part <b>23</b> and the back case <b>30</b> such that the first coupling part <b>23</b> and the back case <b>30</b> are sealed to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the second front case <b>22</b> is further provided with a second coupling part <b>24</b> formed along a circumference of the open front surface of the front case <b>20</b> such that the second front case <b>22</b> is coupled to the first front case <b>21</b> via the second coupling part <b>24</b>. The second coupling part <b>24</b> and the first front case <b>21</b> are securely coupled to each other through a fastening member (S).</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Such a configuration enables the inside of the case <b>10</b> to be sealed to a high degree. In particular, such a configuration enables the inside of the case <b>10</b> to be sealed with a rating of IP66 or above according to International Standards regarding the degree of protection of an enclosure against the intrusion of water and solid objects.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Meanwhile, according this exemplary embodiment, the heat inside the case <b>10</b> is dissipated to the outside while being transmitted through the case <b>10</b>. Accordingly, the case <b>10</b> is formed using a metal having a high thermal conductivity. In addition, the surface of the case <b>10</b> may be subjected to a thermal radiation-enhancing coating which increases the amount of heat radiation and enhances the cooling efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cooling apparatus <b>70</b> of the display apparatus <b>1</b> includes a blower fan <b>90</b> configured to generate a flow movement of air and a frame <b>80</b> configured to guide the flow movement of the air.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The cooling apparatus <b>70</b> is disposed on a sealed space inside the case <b>10</b>. The sealed space represents a space that is formed by the rear surface of the liquid crystal module <b>40</b>, the front surface of the back case <b>30</b>, and inner side surfaces of the front case <b>20</b>. Hereinafter, the sealed space is referred to as a chamber (denoted as reference numeral <b>60</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). As described above, the chamber <b>60</b> is a space sealed to a high degree. The description of the cooling apparatus <b>70</b> will be made later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view used to explain a cooling structure of the display apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a view illustrating a cooling apparatus of the display apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line A-A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line B-B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>, the frame <b>80</b> is disposed in the chamber <b>60</b> to divide the chamber <b>60</b> into a first chamber <b>61</b>, within the frame <b>80</b>, and a second chamber <b>62</b>, outside of the frame <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Meanwhile, in order to allow the amount of heat generation of the first chamber <b>61</b> to be larger than that of the second chamber <b>62</b>, most of the at least one circuit board <b>50</b> is disposed in the first chamber <b>61</b>. Such a disposition provides a benefit to intensively cool off the heat-generating bodies gathered in the first chamber <b>61</b>, and the cooling efficiency is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The frame <b>80</b> is provided in the form of a mold frame having an open front surface and an empty inside. The frame <b>80</b> includes two transverse frame parts <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> and two longitudinal frame parts <b>83</b> and <b>84</b>, the four frame parts <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b> and <b>84</b> forming lateral side parts of the frame <b>80</b>. According to this embodiment, each of the longitudinal frame parts <b>83</b> and <b>84</b> has a length longer than that of each of the transverse frame parts <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Each of the longitudinal frame parts <b>84</b> and <b>84</b>A is provided at an outer side thereof with a plurality of liquid crystal module coupling parts <b>87</b> that have coupling holes and are configured to couple the frame <b>80</b> to the liquid crystal module <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The transverse frame parts <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> and the longitudinal frame parts <b>83</b> and <b>84</b> are disposed between the rear surface of the liquid crystal module <b>40</b> and the front surface of the back case <b>30</b> such that air, or another gas, inside the first chamber <b>61</b> is isolated from air inside the second chamber <b>62</b>. The transverse frame parts <b>81</b> and <b>82</b> and the longitudinal frame parts <b>83</b> and <b>84</b> come into close contact with the rear surface of the liquid crystal module <b>40</b> and the front surface of the back case <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Meanwhile, a substrate mounting part <b>85</b> is provided in the frame <b>80</b>. The substrate mounting part <b>85</b> is provided in the form of a plate while being adjacent to the rear surface of the liquid crystal module <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The substrate mounting part <b>85</b> has an opening <b>86</b> that exposes the rear surface of the liquid crystal module <b>40</b> to dissipate heat generated from the liquid crystal module <b>40</b> into the first chamber <b>61</b>. Such a configuration allows the liquid crystal module <b>40</b> to make contact with the flow movement of air when the blower fan <b>90</b> operates, so that the liquid crystal module <b>40</b> is cooled off together with the circuit board <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The blower fan <b>90</b> is configured to convect air inside the chamber <b>60</b>. The air flow movement generated by the blower fan <b>90</b> is circulated between the first chamber <b>61</b> and the second chamber <b>62</b> while being guided by the frame <b>80</b>. Such a flow movement enables the air to absorb heat from the circuit board <b>50</b> in the first chamber <b>61</b> and dissipate the absorbed heat to the base case <b>30</b> in the second chamber <b>62</b>, thereby cooling the display apparatus <b>1</b>. That is, the air flow movement generated by the blower fan <b>90</b> includes a first flow movement to absorb heat from the circuit board <b>50</b> and a second flow movement to dissipate the absorbed heat to the back case <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The blower fan <b>90</b> may include a plurality of blower fans. According to this example, the blower fan <b>90</b> includes a first blower fan <b>91</b> and a second blower fan <b>92</b> to increase the flow movement and enhance the cooling efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The first blower fan <b>91</b> is provided on the transverse frame <b>81</b> to move air from the first chamber <b>61</b> to the second chamber <b>62</b>. The second blower fan <b>92</b> is provided on the transverse frame <b>82</b> to move air from the second chamber <b>62</b> to the first chamber <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The blower fan <b>90</b> is provided in the form of an axial fan that moves a air in an axial direction. The first blower fan <b>91</b> includes three axial fans <b>93</b>, <b>94</b>, and <b>95</b>, and the second blow fan <b>92</b> includes three axial fans <b>96</b>, <b>97</b>, and <b>98</b>. The number of axial fans included in each of the first blow fan <b>91</b> and the second blower fan <b>92</b> may vary.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The air inside the chamber <b>60</b> circulates between the first chamber <b>61</b> and the second chamber <b>62</b> through the blower fan <b>90</b>, and in particular, circulates along two loops including loop A and loop B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Air flow movement of the loop A is formed to rotate in opposition direction to air flow movement of the loop B. As described above, the cooling apparatus <b>70</b> forms two circulation loops inside the chamber <b>60</b>, so that the display apparatus <b>1</b> is effectively prevented from being locally overheated and also the interior and the surface of the display apparatus <b>1</b> maintain even temperature distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Although exemplary embodiments have been shown and described, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes may be made in these embodiments without departing from the principles and spirit of the inventive concept, the scope of which is defined in the claims and their equivalents.</p>
